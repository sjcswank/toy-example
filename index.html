                        <p>Code Monkey Island is a board game designed for families.
                              It takes about a minute to learn the rules and 45
                              minutes to play, and exposes kids to fundamental
                              programming concepts like control structures, data

                        <p>In today's world, programming is becoming one of the
                            most important skills for students and professionals
                            to have. And programming isn't just for programmers-
                            even for designers like the creator of Code Monkey Island,
                            knowing how to program is almost a requirement to keep

                                          3 red, 3 blue, 3 green, and 3 yellow. Each player

                                          and it's their job to guide them safely around the island!

                                          geography and wildlife. There are 3 types of normal tiles
                                          (tree, vine, and rock), and 3 types of special squares
                                          (fruit, quicksand, and animals).

                                          <p>Players must race their monkeys around the island and up their

                                                on the position of the other monkeys on the board. There are
                                                two basic types of Rule cards: Check and Count.
                                                <br>
                                                Check cards present the player with a conditional statement
                                                - if that conditional statement is true, then they get to move forward!

                                                Count cards ask the player to see how many times the condition
                                                on the card is true, then to move forward: for each time the
                                                condition is true, while the condition is true, or until the
                                                condition is true.

                                              banana grove who can give you boosts! When one of your
                                              monkeys lands on an animal tile, draw an animal card,
                                              and then set it down in front of you. The card will show
                                              a number, which the animal tile will "store" for you
                                              (and only you!). The next time one of your monkeys lands
                                              on that same animal tile, your animal buddy will give you
                                              a boost equal to the number it's been assigned!

                      <h3>What You'll Learn</h3>

                      <div class="content">
                          <p>Code Monkey Island introduces kids to the fundamentals
                              of programming logic, which are shared across all
                              modern programming languages:

                        <h4>Conditional Statements </h4>
                        <p>Together with loops, conditional statements form the
                            foundations of programming control structures. With
                            Check cards, kids learn how to employ if/then and if/else
                            statements to achieve one of several outcomes.</p>

                        <h4>Looping</h4>
                        <p>Another one of the foundations of control structures,
                            loops allow programmers to perform the same action
                            multiple times without having to do extra work! With
                            Count cards, kids learn basic looping such as: for,
                            while, and until loops.</p>

                        <h4>Boolean Logic</h4>
                        <p>Code Monkey Island relies on players deciding whether
                            something is true or false, and experiencing different
                            outcomes in each case. Boolean Logic is a simple but
                            incredibly important concept for programmers!<p>

                        <h4>Boolean Operators</h4>
                        <p>Knowing the difference between “When x is true AND when
                            y is true”, “When x is true OR y is true”, and “When x
                            is NOT true” is a hugely important logical hurdle to
                            leap. Code Monkey Island makes it child’s play!</p>

                        <h4>Assignment</h4>
                        <p>Code Monkey Island frequently asks players to assign
                            different values and states to a variety of objects,
                            and then to hold and eventually call that value at
                            the appropriate time.</p>

                        <h4>Data Structures</h4>
                        <p>In the Kickstarter-exclusive Super Fruits mini game,
                            kids learn the difference between the stack and the queue,
                            how to add and remove elements from each, and the
                            importance of avoiding stack overflow!</p>

                      <p>*Note: in the video, it's stated that when a monkey lands on a
                          Boost in a Bottle tile, the boost can be used at any other
                          Boost in a Bottle tile. This is incorrect! The boost that's
                          earned can only be redeemed at the Boost in a Bottle tile
                          that was originally landed upon.</p>
